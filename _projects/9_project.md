Berkeley CS61A 课程实验和项目

#### [项目地址](https://github.com/liukanshan1/CS61B)

The CS 61 series is an introduction to Computer Science, with particular emphasis on software and machines from a programmer’s point of view. CS 61A covered high-level approaches to problem-solving, providing you with a variety of ways to organize solutions to programming problems as compositions of functions, collections of objects, or sets of rules. In CS 61B, we move to a somewhat more detailed (and to some extent, more basic) level of programming.

In CS 61A, the *correctness* of a program was our primary goal. In CS 61B, we’re also concerned with engineering. An engineer, it is said, is someone who can do for a dime what any fool can do for a dollar. Much of CS 61B will be concerned with the tradeoffs in time and memory for a variety of methods for structuring data. We’ll also be concerned with the *engineering* knowledge and skills needed to build and maintain moderately large programs.
